# Univariate linear regressor using gradient descent
This is a univariate linear regressor implementation from scratch which uses gradient descent algorithm to train on some data. Predicitions from this trained model are compared with the trained data to calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE). Cost per iteration and decision boundary is plotted for better visualization.
